NR1B-SQT56 / HX1K design notes

- GBIN pins have global behavior, avoid using?
- Datasheet: "The internal power-on-reset (POR) signal is deactivated when VCC, VCCIO_2, VPP_2V5, and VCC_SPI have reached the level defined in Table 4.4."
- IOs are tristated on power-on
- IO banks support LVCMOS 1.8, 2.5, and 3.3v -- VCCIO must be one of these
- Power rails:
	- VCC: 1.2V
	- VCCIO: 3.3V,
	- VPP_2V5, master SPI mode: 2.5-3.3
	- VCCPLL: 1.2V Do we need this?
	- VPP_FAST: Float
	- VCC_SPI: 1.8-3.3
- Power ramp rate: 0.4V/ms. For 3.3V t_ramp = 8.25ms
	- Sequence: Each supply must reach 0.5V before the next supply can be ramped
		1. VCC and VCCPLL
		2. SPI_VCCIO1
		3. VPP_2V5
	- Remaining rails may be powered any time after step 1.
- Configuration time: 53/24/15ms (default 53 / "low frequency" / 7.5MHz)
- PLL
	- Not required?
	- GNDPLL must NOT be connected to board ground
- Configuration pins:
	- CBSEL[1:0]
	- CRESET_B: configuration reset, active low. Actively driven or pulled to VCCIO_2(?) with 10K resistor
	- CDONE: Output. Pull to VCCIO_2(?) with resistor of value 1/(2*ConfigFrequency*CDONETraceCap) where ConfigFrequency is the internal oscillator frequency
	- SPI_SS: On configuration, logic level on this pin detemines mode:
		- 1 = if configured for NVCM then NVCM else SPI master
		- 0 = SPI Slave
		- So we want 1 and a 10k pull to VCC_SPI

- Boot mode:
	- Warm Boot controlled by running configuration
	- Cold Boot enabled in configuration, set with CBSEL[1:0]
		- CBSEL = Vector address at start of SPI

- SPI: Need to be able to flash external SPI
	- SPI Requirements:
		- 0x0B Fast Read with 24b start address and 8 initial dummy bits
		- Nice to have: 0xB9 Deep Power Down and 0xAB Release from Deep Power Down
		- Ready 10us from power on
	- Reset jumper + SPI flash IO with FTDI cable should work
